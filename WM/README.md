# Wolfram (Mathematica) files

This folder contains Wolfram Mathematica Notebook (`.nb`) files with exact symbolic
definitions of the moments μ_{2n}(V) of the infinite-temperature current
autocorrelation function.

Each moment is provided as an explicit polynomial in the interaction
strength V and can be directly evaluated or manipulated in Mathematica.

Explicit formulas for arbitrary t and V are also provided.
